# How do neural adaptation and expectation contribute to the representation of complex objects?
This repository contains the files and codes related to my master's thesis project which tries to answer the above question.

## Research Question
To investigate the predictive coding theory, I employ Electroencephalography (EEG) to uncover how the brain signals prediction errors during tasks.  In my masterâ€™s thesis, we aim to answer a key question in predictive coding theory: Can we dissociate repetition-related and expectation-related effects on vMMN? How do these mechanisms contribute to vMMN?
