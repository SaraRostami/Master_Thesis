# How do neural adaptation and expectation contribute to the representation of complex objects?
This repository contains the files and codes related to my master's thesis project which tries to answer the above question.

## Hypothesis
To investigate the predictive coding theory, I employ Electroencephalography (EEG) to uncover how the brain signals prediction errors during tasks.  In my masterâ€™s thesis, we aim to answer a key question in predictive coding theory: How do neural adaptation and expectation contribute to the representation of complex visual stimuli in frontotemporal circuits?
Considering the dynamic involvement of the prefrontal cortex in predicting incoming visual signals and the distinguished role of temporal cortices in encoding complex visual stimuli, we posit a distinctive contribution of frontotemporal circuits in the representation of complex objects within the context of expectation.
